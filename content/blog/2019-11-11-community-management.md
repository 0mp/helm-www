[Devstats](https://helm.devstats.cncf.io/) and stats on GitHub are able to capture many different types of contributions to an open source project. But there is one type of contribution we have yet to figure out a good metric for and it has been essential in Helm's success. That is community management.

Karen Chu has handled community management for Helm since it was first announced at the inaugural KubeCon in San Francisco. Her work ranges from big things, like pulling off two Helm Summits, down to small things, like the Helm twitter account.

For Helm's entire life, this role has been psuedo-official. There has been no Helm related title or sub-project of Helm for this. We are happy that we have now rectified the situation by making community management a sub-project of Helm with Karen as the person running the show.

Community managers do so much to make open source successful. Dave Neary, a community architect at Red Had, highlighted some of the areas of value they bring in [a post](https://community.redhat.com/blog/2018/01/the-many-faces-of-the-community-manager/) last year. He talked about activities ranging from partnerships to developer enablement.

If you want to learn more about community management at North American 2019 KubeCon and CloudNativeCon, Karen is part of a [panel titled, "Whatâ€™s Essential in an OSS Project Launch Playbook?"](https://sched.co/Uabt).
